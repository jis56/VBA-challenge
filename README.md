# VBAScript

A script was created to analyze stock market data that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:

  1)The ticker symbol
  
  2)Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of    that year
  
  3)The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the      end of that year
  
  4)The total stock volume of the stock
  
Conditional formatting was also scripted so that it will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
